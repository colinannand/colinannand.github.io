densely meshed nest of leaves, undersides hued lighter green than dark tear-drop tops, cross and recross the illusory sky blue that fades to white where it pools across the horizon.

*Maia* giggles inappropriately in my mind, as if they told a dirty joke in a formal setting, their blue brush paint graffitied the inverted pointillism galleria on display when I slept.

Before I had awakened, the illusion was complete. If I sit still, perfectly, breath held, the blue and green and white is flat, a canvas painting immediate to my eyes, before me, wrapping around me - I reach out, fingers extended to dip into pigmented pools but my hand returns dry, holding nothing, nothing holding, holding nothing, nothing holding.

Dearest reflection, 

The intensity of your eye-contact is unnerving. 
I prefer, by far, your refracted cousin I find in my iPhone galleria, 
gaze averted towards some infinity point, 
plastered with blissful smile.,
empty of intent, 

I choose an emotion to pour into its shallow pool, 
tinting that past with this presents fuel.
