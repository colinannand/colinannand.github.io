## Chaotic Dynamics

Chaotic dynamics give rise to interesting and [beguiling patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal). When we analyze the seeming chaos in a certain way, we find harmonious and and clear indications of structure. The image linked above is a stylized model of a [bifurcation diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_diagram) discretized/simplified between two stable states. In the experiments these two states correspond to the two fingers/two choices in a set of  YES/NO cognitive discrimination task. 

Among the fantastical sounding chaotic patterns contained therein, and elucidated in the dissertation are;
- [The Devil's Staircase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_function)
- The Golden Path Ratio (*Aligns to a particularly stable anti-phase mode of oscillation, can't find a wiki for this one*)
 
## Abstract (Frontiers)

The latencies of successive two-alternative, forced-choice response times display intricately patterned sequential effects, or dependencies. They vary as a function of particular trial-histories, and in terms of the order and identity of previously presented stimuli and registered responses. This article tests a novel hypothesis that sequential effects are governed by dynamic principles, such as those entailed by a discrete sine-circle map adaptation of the Haken Kelso Bunz (HKB) bimanual coordination model. The model explained the sequential effects expressed in two classic sequential dependency data sets. It explained the rise of a repetition advantage, the acceleration of repeated affirmative responses, in tasks with faster paces. 
Likewise, the model successfully predicted an alternation advantage, the acceleration of interleaved affirmative and negative responses, when a taskâ€™s pace slows and becomes more variable. Detailed analyses of five studies established oscillatory influences on sequential effects in the context of balanced and biased trial presentation rates, variable pacing, progressive and differential cognitive loads, and dyadic performance. Overall, the empirical patterns revealed lawful oscillatory constraints governing sequential effects in the time-course and accuracy of performance across a broad continuum of recognition and decision activities.[^1] 
 
## Why this is interesting

I'm coming back to writing this description. But simply put, when you have non-linear characteristics (hystersis) in cognitve performance, it means you can't have singular, state-based (think digital, computer systems) as the underlying foundation. If you are reading this in 2025 or further on, this is probably not at all surprising given how much progress has been made with backpropagating, feedback loop stytle LLMs and AI, in fact it seems like the default, but in academics this was not cleanly resolved. A long long push for computation theoretical perspectives on how people thought had started in the 60s, but it was difficult to show that cognitive performance was digital/state based with *noise* as opposed to fully dynamic (or at least that it shouldn't be modeled that way). 

To wit, "you can get linear dynamics from a complex system, but you can't get non-linear dynamics for a linear system" - [Mike Richardson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DJPcjuQAAAAJ&hl=en)
