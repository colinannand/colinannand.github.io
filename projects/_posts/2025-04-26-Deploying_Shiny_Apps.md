## The Following Example is an embeded Shiny Dashboard
- Shiny Apps are interactive explorations of data.
- They can be coded and embedded in webpages like this, or run from a server.
- They can fill a sizeable niche in exploratory data products and useful *self-service analytics* without having to use a dashboarding solution like Tableau or PowerBI

## Default - Example Shiny App
- The code for this is located in my github repository:
