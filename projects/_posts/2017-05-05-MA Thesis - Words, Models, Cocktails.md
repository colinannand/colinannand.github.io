## Abstract

Participants provided decisions in three-word recognition experiments designed to keep stimulus and response constant while simultaneously manipulating task demands: go-no-go naming, lexical decision, and semantic categorization. The aggregate response time distributions of these tasks were analyzed with a lognormal inverse power-law mixture distribution, the cocktail model (Holden & Rajaraman, 2012), to probe the influence of longer timescale demands on cognitive dynamics. Changes in task demands influenced the shape of the response time distributions, despite identical stimuli across the tasks. The outcomes are discussed in terms of the influence of temporally nested networks of performance. Constraints are aspects of physical, perceptual or cognitive systems that shape behavior in particular ways. For instance, linguistic development unfolds a long timescale of development. However, the influence of these constraints are expressed on much faster timescale activities, such as acts of individual word recognition and articulation. Fast timescale cognitive dynamics are influenced by a web of longer contextual and historical constraints (Van Orden, Hollis, & Wallot, 2012). The narrative explains how the characteristic shapes of response time distributions reveal these influences.
