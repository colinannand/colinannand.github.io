The prayer of serenity. Breathe, breathe - the moment is timeless.
Impartial to concern, simultaneous with all change. 
Stretching the present, expanding its limits, until the past
Is now and nothing, future is now and nothing.

The study of a leaf, lasting Longer than the season of autumn. 

Breathe, the breath of serenity, the moment floods me,
Air filling and expanding, becoming me, as I breathe out and become it
The sky is endless, sweeping over the vastness of earth, 
Ever present lit in the day and invisible at night, still present.
It is here and nowhere. Itself And nothing. 

The shape of a cloud as permanent as a mountain.

Listen, to the sound of serenity, the silence around me,
The noise rising, of traffic, or chatter - birdsong and rustling leaves
The sound is unceasing, echoing off walls and twisting over hills.
It is near, and it is distant, deafening earfuls, and impercitbly soft steps of insects

The sound of the universe, serene, humming, breathing, beating your heart.
